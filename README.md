# 🌫️ Breathing Numbers: What PM2.5 Data Reveals About Air Quality

## 📌 Project Overview
Breathing Numbers is a data-driven analysis of air quality with a focused study on PM2.5 pollution in Kolkata (2022–2024).  
The project uses statistical analysis, time-series decomposition, and visualization techniques to understand seasonal patterns, long-term trends, and spatial variation in air pollution.

Official data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is used to evaluate public health risks and propose actionable, data-backed urban policy interventions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compare Kolkata’s AQI with major Indian cities (2024)
- Analyze PM2.5 trends from 2022 to 2024
- Identify seasonality and long-term trends using STL decomposition
- Study station-wise PM2.5 variability within Kolkata
- Propose data-driven pollution mitigation strategies

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Kolkata’s average AQI (~100) frequently falls under the "Moderately Polluted" category
- Strong seasonal dependence with winter peaks and monsoon-driven lows
- STL decomposition shows:
  - Seasonal Strength: 0.835
  - Trend Strength: 0.927
- Green zones like Rabindra Sarobar record comparatively lower PM2.5 levels
- Extreme pollution spikes (>200 µg/m³) occur across all stations, posing chronic health risks

---

## 🧠 Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-series analysis using STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS)
- Statistical interpretation of seasonal strength, trend strength, and spikiness
- Visualization using line plots, bar charts, and boxplots

## 🌱 Policy & Urban Planning Suggestions
- Airshed-based pollution management across regions
- Miyawaki micro-forests at traffic-heavy zones
- Low Emission Zones (LEZs) in high-risk areas
- Public health alerts when PM2.5 exceeds 70 µg/m³
- Ward-level IoT-based pollution monitoring

---

## 📌 Conclusion
Although Kolkata’s air quality appears manageable on average, frequent extreme PM2.5 spikes and strong seasonal effects indicate a persistent public health concern.  
This project demonstrates how data science can support environmental policy, urban planning, and health-focused decision-making.
